SOMAscan,"Log2 (baseline-corrected) averages per arm*time point; statistical comparisons between arms (with and without BMI adjustment) at each post-baseline time point after correcting for baseline (i.e. a difference of differences) with p-values, FDRs, log2 fold-change (FC), and FC; SOMAscan probe annotation"
Soma_sig,"Baseline-corrected between-group significance and direction (as {-1, 0, 1}, where -1=downregulated; +1=upregulated; 0=nonsignificant) of each protein at each post-baseline time point and annotation for proteins significant anytime"
Metabolites,"Log2 (baseline-corrected) averages per arm*time point; statistical comparisons between arms (with and without BMI adjustment) at each post-baseline time point after correcting for baseline (i.e. a difference of differences) with p-values, FDRs, log2 fold-change (FC), and FC; metabolite annotation"
Met_sig,"Baseline-corrected between-group significance and direction (as {-1, 0, 1}, where -1=downregulated; +1=upregulated; 0=nonsignificant) of each metabolite at each post-baseline time point and annotation for metabolites significant anytime"
Soma_met_r,"Pearson correlation coefficients between baseline-corrected top proteins and metabolites at 3 months, color using Excel Conditional Formatting."
Roast_between_arm,"Roast comparing between arms at 3 months after correcting for baseline (i.e. a difference of differences). Columns give number of nodes (metabolites or proteins) in data and the pathway; pathway significance from testing if a pathway is up or down; and pathway ""Mixed"" significance from testing if a pathway's analytes tend to change without regard to direction (i.e. if analyte changes have a large absolute value), so a pathway can be significant even if some analytes go up and others go equally down."
Hitman_soma_HbA1c,"Hitman of: arm (E) --> somalogic differences at 3 months from baseline (M) --> difference in HbA1c at 12 months from baseline (Y). EMY.p, EMY.FDR, and EMY.chisq give mediation p-value, FDR, and chi-square value on 1 df (greater is more signif). EM describes arm --> soma; MY describes soma --> A1c."
Hitman_met_HbA1c,"Hitman of: arm (E) --> metabolomic differences at 3 months from baseline (M) --> difference in HbA1c at 12 months from baseline (Y). EMY.p, EMY.FDR, and EMY.chisq give mediation p-value, FDR, and chi-square value on 1 df (greater is more signif). EM describes arm --> met; MY describes met --> A1c."
Hitman_clin_HbA1c,"Hitman of: arm (E) --> clinical differences at 3 months from baseline (M) --> difference in HbA1c at 12 months from baseline (Y). EMY.p, EMY.FDR, and EMY.chisq give mediation p-value, FDR, and chi-square value on 1 df (greater is more signif). EM describes arm --> clinical; MY describes Clnical --> A1c. "
Hitman_soma_dins030,"Hitman of: arm (E) --> somalogic differences at 3 months from baseline (M) --> difference in insulin secretion change (dins030) at 12 months from baseline (Y). EMY.p, EMY.FDR, and EMY.chisq give mediation p-value, FDR, and chi-square value on 1 df (greater is more signif). EM describes arm --> soma; MY describes soma --> dins030. "
Hitman_met_dins030,"Hitman of: arm (E) --> metabolomic differences at 3 months from baseline (M) --> difference in dins030 at 12 months from baseline (Y). EMY.p, EMY.FDR, and EMY.chisq give mediation p-value, FDR, and chi-square value on 1 df (greater is more signif). EM describes arm --> met; MY describes met --> dins030."
Hitman_soma_homair,"Hitman of: arm (E) --> somalogic differences at 3 months from baseline (M) --> difference in homair at 12 months from baseline (Y). EMY.p, EMY.FDR, and EMY.chisq give mediation p-value, FDR, and chi-square value on 1 df (greater is more signif). EM describes arm --> soma; MY describes soma --> homair. "
Hitman_met_homair,"Hitman of: arm (E) --> metabolomic differences at 3 months from baseline (M) --> difference in homair at 12 months from baseline (Y). EMY.p, EMY.FDR, and EMY.chisq give mediation p-value, FDR, and chi-square value on 1 df (greater is more signif). EM describes arm --> met; MY describes met --> homair."
Hitman_CAMERA_homair,"CAMERA pathway analysis of Hitman EMY.chisq scores. Columns give number of analytes from dataset in pathway, and pathway direction, p-value, and FDR."
