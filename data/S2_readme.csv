SOMAscan,"Log2 averages per arm*time point; statistical comparisons between arms at each post-baseline time point after correcting for baseline (i.e. a difference of differences) with p-values, FDRs, log2 fold-change (FC), and FC; SOMAscan probe annotation"
Metabolites,"Log2 averages per arm*time point; statistical comparisons between arms at each post-baseline time point after correcting for baseline (i.e. a difference of differences) with p-values, FDRs, log2 fold-change (FC), and FC; metabolite annotation"
soma_met_r,"Pearson correlation coefficients between baseline-corrected top proteins and metabolites at 3 months, color using Excel Conditional Formatting."
Pants_between_arm,"Pants comparing between arms at 3 months after correcting for baseline (i.e. a difference of differences). Columns give number of nodes (metabolites or proteins) in data and the pathway; pathway z-score, p-value, and FDR."
Hitman_soma_HbA1c,Hitman of: arm (E) --> somalogic differences at 3 months from baseline (M) --> difference in HbA1c at 12 months from baseline (Y). EMY.p and EMY.FDR give mediation p-value and FDR. EM describes arm --> soma; MY describes soma --> A1c. EM_dir and MY_dir account for direction. 
Hitman_met_HbA1c,Hitman of: arm (E) --> metabolomic differences at 3 months from baseline (M) --> difference in HbA1c at 12 months from baseline (Y). EMY.p and EMY.FDR give mediation p-value and FDR. EM describes arm --> met; MY describes met --> A1c. EM_dir and MY_dir account for direction.
Lottman_clin_HbA1c,Lotman of: arm (E) --> clinical differences at 3 months from baseline (M) --> difference in HbA1c at 12 months from baseline (Y). EMY.p and EMY.FDR give mediation p-value and FDR. EM describes arm --> clinical; MY describes Clnical --> A1c. EM_dir and MY_dir account for direction. 
Hitman_soma_dins030,Hitman of: arm (E) --> somalogic differences at 3 months from baseline (M) --> difference in insulin secretion change (dins030) at 12 months from baseline (Y). EMY.p and EMY.FDR give mediation p-value and FDR. EM describes arm --> soma; MY describes soma --> dins030. EM_dir and MY_dir account for direction. 
Hitman_met_dins030,Hitman of: arm (E) --> metabolomic differences at 3 months from baseline (M) --> difference in dins030 at 12 months from baseline (Y). EMY.p and EMY.FDR give mediation p-value and FDR. EM describes arm --> met; MY describes met --> dins030. EM_dir and MY_dir account for direction.
Hitman_soma_homair,Hitman of: arm (E) --> somalogic differences at 3 months from baseline (M) --> difference in homair at 12 months from baseline (Y). EMY.p and EMY.FDR give mediation p-value and FDR. EM describes arm --> soma; MY describes soma --> homair. EM_dir and MY_dir account for direction. 
Hitman_met_homair,Hitman of: arm (E) --> metabolomic differences at 3 months from baseline (M) --> difference in homair at 12 months from baseline (Y). EMY.p and EMY.FDR give mediation p-value and FDR. EM describes arm --> met; MY describes met --> homair. EM_dir and MY_dir account for direction.
Hitman_Pants_homair,"Pants coupled with Hitman as in Hitman_soma_homair and Hitman_met_homair testing pathway mediation. Columns give number of nodes (metabolites or proteins) in data and the pathway; pathway z-score, p-value, and FDR."
