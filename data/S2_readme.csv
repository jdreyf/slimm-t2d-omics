SOMAscan,"Log2 (baseline-corrected) averages per arm*time point; statistical comparisons between arms (with and without BMI adjustment) at each post-baseline time point after correcting for baseline (i.e. a difference of differences) with p-values, FDRs, log2 fold-change (FC), and FC; SOMAscan probe annotation"
Soma_sig,"Baseline-corrected between-group significance and direction (as {-1, 0, 1}, where -1=downregulated; +1=upregulated; 0=nonsignificant) of each protein at each post-baseline time point and annotation for proteins significant anytime"
Soma_dmcure,"Log2 baseline-corrected averages at 3mo for those who did (not) achieve glycemic goals (dmcure) within RYGB; statistical comparisons between groups with p-values, FDRs, log2 fold-change (FC), and FC; SOMAscan probe annotation"
Metabolites,"Log2 (baseline-corrected) averages per arm*time point; statistical comparisons between arms (with and without BMI adjustment) at each post-baseline time point after correcting for baseline (i.e. a difference of differences) with p-values, FDRs, log2 fold-change (FC), and FC; metabolite annotation"
Met_sig,"Baseline-corrected between-group significance and direction (as {-1, 0, 1}, where -1=downregulated; +1=upregulated; 0=nonsignificant) of each metabolite at each post-baseline time point and annotation for metabolites significant anytime"
Met_dmcure,"Log2 baseline-corrected averages at 3mo for those who did (not) achieve glycemic goals (dmcure) within RYGB; statistical comparisons between groups with p-values, FDRs, log2 fold-change (FC), and FC; metabolite annotation"
Soma_met_r,"Pearson correlation coefficients between baseline-corrected top proteins and metabolites at 3 months, color using Excel Conditional Formatting."
Roast_between_arm,"Roast comparing between arms at 3 months after correcting for baseline (i.e. a difference of differences). Columns give number of nodes (metabolites or proteins) in data and the pathway; pathway p-value, and FDR for Roast's ""Mixed"" statistic, which is similar to using absolute value."
Hitman_soma_HbA1c,Hitman of: arm (E) --> somalogic differences at 3 months from baseline (M) --> difference in HbA1c at 12 months from baseline (Y). EMY.p and EMY.FDR give mediation p-value and FDR. EM describes arm --> soma; MY describes soma --> A1c.

Hitman_clin_HbA1c,Hitman of: arm (E) --> clinical differences at 3 months from baseline (M) --> difference in HbA1c at 12 months from baseline (Y). EMY.p and EMY.FDR give mediation p-value and FDR. EM describes arm --> clinical; MY describes Clnical --> A1c. 
Hitman_soma_dins030,Hitman of: arm (E) --> somalogic differences at 3 months from baseline (M) --> difference in insulin secretion change (dins030) at 12 months from baseline (Y). EMY.p and EMY.FDR give mediation p-value and FDR. EM describes arm --> soma; MY describes soma --> dins030. 
Hitman_met_dins030,Hitman of: arm (E) --> metabolomic differences at 3 months from baseline (M) --> difference in dins030 at 12 months from baseline (Y). EMY.p and EMY.FDR give mediation p-value and FDR. EM describes arm --> met; MY describes met --> dins030.
